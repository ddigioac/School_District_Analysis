# School District Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis

Reading and math scores of grade nine students from Thomas High School will be excluded from the investigation to contrast how these changes influenced the overall analysis.

## School District Summary

Overall, we saw some changes in our original analysis compared to our new analysis with the removal of reading and math scores of grade nine students at Thomas High School. The first change was an updated student count. The number of students that are in ninth grade at Thomas High School was subtracted from the total student count to get the new total student count. This resulted in a negligible difference in our district summary. Secondly, we saw three considerable changes within our school summary. For Thomas High School, the percentage of students passing math increased from 67% to 93%. The percentage of students passing reading increased from 70% to 97% and lastly, the percentage of students passing overall increased from 65% to 91%.
